Project Name: Basic Non-Responsive Netflix Clone Prototype

Description:
The Basic Non-Responsive Netflix Clone Prototype is a simple web development project hosted on GitHub, which aims to provide a static representation of Netflix's desktop website without any responsive design features or user authentication.

Features:

    Static Content: The website replicates the static layout and design of Netflix's desktop site as of the project's creation date. It includes a fixed header, footer, and a grid-style display of movie and TV show thumbnails.

    Content Categories: Similar to Netflix, it offers content categories such as "Trending Now," "Top Picks," "Action," "Comedy," and more.

    Movie/Show Thumbnails: Each category displays a selection of movie and TV show thumbnails with their respective titles and brief descriptions. Clicking on a thumbnail does not lead to any actual content but serves as a placeholder.

    Navigation: The website includes navigation options like a static top menu and a horizontal scrolling row of categories.

Technologies Used:

    HTML: For structuring the website's content.
    CSS: For styling and layout.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this project is to create a very basic, non-responsive prototype of a Netflix-like interface. It does not include any interactive features, user authentication, or real content but instead serves as a visual mockup or proof of concept.

GitHub Repository:
The project's GitHub repository provides access to the source code and project files, allowing other developers to examine the code and potentially use it as a starting point for their own projects or as a reference for creating static website prototypes.

Please note that this is an extremely simplified version and lacks many of the features and functionalities that a real Netflix clone would have. It's meant for educational or demonstrative purposes and does not offer any real-world utility.
